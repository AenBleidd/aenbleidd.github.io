In the [last report](2025.05.11.html), I wrote that we are working hard to release the new version of BOINC in May 2025.
Unfortunately, we are still not ready to release it, but we are very close to it.
The main reason for the delay is that we are still working on the MacOS version of the new [BUDA functionality](2024.12.01.html).
We are almost there, but we need a little bit more time to test it.

There were no any other significant changes in the last month, except for the [BUDA functionality](2024.12.01.html) improvements and bug fixes on the [BOINC Central](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/central/) platform.
We are still working on the new [BUDA functionality](2024.12.01.html) to make it more stable and reliable for the scientists who are going to use it in the future.
Recently we have achieved a first important milestone: the [first project](https://orunge.org/boolean-chains/) has [successfully finished its first series of jobs](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/central/forum_thread.php?id=33) on the [BOINC Central](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/central/) platform.
During this series, the project has successfully generated 37,444,981,252,103,000 boolean chains with the total computation time of 2,139 days.
We are very happy with this achievement and we are looking forward to the next phase of that project, with more projects joining us and running their applications on the platform.

With this report I stop writing the monthly reports, since they are quite short and not very informative.
My goal of this blog was always to share some information about the BOINC development process, but most of the time there is not much to share.
I have never a goal to PR myself or make any money out of this blog or any other social media accounts I have.
So there is no monetization, no ads, no sponsors, no clickbait titles.
I will continue to share the information about the BOINC development process, but only when there is something significant to share.

Stay tuned and happy crunching!
