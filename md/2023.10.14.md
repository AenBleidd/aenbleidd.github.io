Several weeks ago I was working on a solution for a bug that was in Android BOINC for at least 4 years. This bug was very minor, that is why it was not fixed during all this time.

This was not the easiest bug to fix, and it required quite a deep research into Android internals, so I decided that it would be nice to share my findings (there will be a post about it later).

Usually I don't like writing long posts, but sometimes it's very important to share some information, including the technical one, with the people who might be interested in it. Also, such a posts might bring some light to the technical and design solutions in BOINC.

So, if any of you ever asked a question like "Why this was done in BOINC in this way?", you could probably find some answers in this blog.

I'm not a blogger, but I'll try to share more information about BOINC and what happens around it. This blog will not contain any personal and/or any other information that is not related to BOINC in one or another way. Also, the posts will be more or less big. That is why it will be updated very rare. Shorter but more frequent news and updates I usually post on my [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/AenVampire) and/or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@AenBleidd) pages.
