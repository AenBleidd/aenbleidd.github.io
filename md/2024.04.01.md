Recently it was discovered that liblzma - the popular library for data compression/decompression - contains a [severe vulnerability](https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/).

Unfortunately, BOINC 8.0.0, that is available for alpha testing, was built with the malicious 5.6.0 version of this library.

This is because liblzma is the dependency of libtiff that is a dependency of wxWidgets, that is used to build the GUI of BOINC Manager.

As far as we can see, this issue doesn't affect our users, since the target of this 'backdoor' is an sshd process, and BOINC doesn't work with it in any way. Just to highlight one more time: only BOINC Manager was built with this library, and BOINC client doesn't use this dependency at all. So we strongly believe that our users are completely safe while using BOINC version 8.0.0.

But since the analysis of this backdoor is not finished yet, we have decided to build another release 8.0.1 that downgrades the liblzma version to 5.4.4 that is completely safe. According to the available data, this backdoor works on Linux only, that is why BOINC 8.0.1 will be released for alpha testing for Linux only.

We will continue monitoring the situation, and if needed, will release 8.0.1 for other platforms as well.

Please use this page to find the instructions about using the [BOINC Linux packages](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/linux_install.php).

Thank you for understanding.
