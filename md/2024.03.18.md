One may wonder, looking a the list below, why to change the major release version if there are not so much changes made after the last release.

The main reason for that is the support of the new type of application that allows running AI/ML applications on BOINC infrastructure, that have different requirements. It's explained in more details [here](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/wiki/Sporadic-Applications).

Also, starting from the upcoming release, we will provide our own [BOINC vanilla packages for the major Linux distributions](2024.02.28.html)

Although the current list of supported Linux distributions is quite short and contains only 4 of them, more will be added later. We tried to concentrate on the most popular distributions, and will add others step-by-step.

In this release the detection of [Android GPUs was finally fixed](2024.03.16.html).

This Release Candidate should be available for a public alpha testing before the end of March 2024.

The list of the most important changes, introduced in the next release you can find below.
