# BOINC Development Status Report: January 2025

### A New Year, A New BOINC Release Plan

The start of 2025 brought an important question: when will the next BOINC release be ready? For over six months, we had been planning version 8.0.5 — a bugfix update with critical improvements. Just as we were about to launch, we hit an unexpected roadblock: an expired license key (which I’ve discussed in a [previous post](2025.01.01.html)).

This delay led to a buildup of numerous updates—many of them significant improvements—making a simple bugfix release increasingly impractical. On top of that, switching to a new Windows installer, a major structural change, further complicated things. Attempting to isolate only bugfixes would have meant delaying several exciting new features that had been developed in the meantime.

Given this, we’ve decided to skip the 8.0.5 release and move directly to version 8.2.0. This update will introduce a host of enhancements, including preliminary support for [Docker applications](2024.12.01.html). Our target release window is before the end of Q1 2025. This will serve as a stepping stone toward BOINC 9.0.0, which will feature full support for [BUDA applications](2024.12.01.html).

We’ll share the complete list of new features and fixes for 8.2.0 as we get closer to launch, so stay tuned—the next blog post will be packed with details!
